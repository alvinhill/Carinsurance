# Carinsurance
 ## Introduction

This was my favorite program because I gained a good deal of practical experience doing this program.  

Before I dismissed Entity Framework as a “gimmick” and code-first as “not useful”.  Wow, was I wrong!  I was biased by some bad cumbersome youtube videos.  I was satisfied with database-first and I was used to using full SQL code to link to a database.

I quickly found out how easily and cleanly code-first was able to create a working CRUD database without all the SQL code.  

The strength of the program is:

1.)	 Instant creation of a fully functional CRUD database.
2.)	The ability to affect and manipulate and display data in the database.

## Conclusion
 
This MVC project is a web application that works like a commercial insurance website. It gathers the user’s information and computes a quote based on business logic. Age, tickets DUI and other rules are processed to compute an insurance quote. The database functions provide CRUD functions. The admin page provides the final quote information based on the user’s input.
